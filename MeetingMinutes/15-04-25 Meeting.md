 **PROGRESS**  

1.Discuss about the progress thus far

We discussed about the sections that will be included in the final IAR. Individual group members made a short talk about his/her work contribution to the report. The team also made decisions on how to include references for pictures and charts inside our IAR.

2.Refinement of layout and template

In response to comments and constructive criticism that we received in the class earlier this week, we decided to refine and make few appropriate adjustments, during the meeting we managed to solve some technical issues with "Microsoft Word" which we will use for the IAR.


 **COMMITMENTS**

***Whole Group***:

1. Each individual member gathers information and creates a separate word documents for section  in which he/she is in charge of along with correct references for texts, diagrams and charts.

2. Each individual member finds out how to integrate the concept 'Block Chain' in to our IAR.

3. Each individual member attempts his/her remaining uncompleted work(s) that were assigned during any earlier meeting minutes(if any). For example: creating IAR outline, filling data collection table, signing markdown files.
