***1. Solve the GitHub procedure problems in order to be all able to modify and upload files***

Konstantin gave the standard procedures to follow after having made changes on shared files: add/ commit/ push and other useful tips like commenting on deveral file changes at the same time... Getting used to those new functions. 

***2. Determine an outline for the Wednesday presentation***

After making some research for articles and explanations about fuel cell, decided to present our group with the reasons why we picked our name: Bambu, but also the different topics we had considered for the Industry Analysis Report and eventually why Fuel Cells had gotten our interest more specifically.

 **COMMITMENTS**

***Whole Group***
-Read more I.A.R.
