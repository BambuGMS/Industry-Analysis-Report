Product Perspective

The basic principle underlying in the fuel cell technology is to combine oxygen and hydrogen to produce electricity and water. As well as a battery, it provides electricity out of a chemical reaction. The main difference lies in the fact that a fuel cell uses an external sources of hydrogen and oxygen to keep running. The hydrogen source will later be referred to as the fuel.
The structure of the product is meant to enable such a chemical reaction. It consists of an electrolyte and 2 electrodes. The electrolyte is the element that sets the temperature of operation. The range of temperature then determines what catalyst is to be used in order to accelerate the reaction and what fuel can be used. What with the electrodes, they are of two types: the anode where the fuel is being oxidized, and the cathode where oxygen gets reduced. As a result, the voltage of a fuel cell circuit has an order of magnitude of 1 V. Higher values can be reached by assembling several fuel cells in stacks.

In this second part, the reader will be provided with an explanation on the way a fuel cell works. A listing of the different technologies available today will also be made according to their characteristics. These define the application perspectives for the product. In the end, some paragraphs will be dedicated to the infrastructure necessary to the production and the distribution of hydrogen.
