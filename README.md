Introduction about the team

- Why the name Bambu? (Bambu shares the same pronunciation as the plant 'bamboo' which is strong, fast growing,  has multipurpose utility , and it is also a favorite choice for Chinese fine arts and paintings)

- Why Bambu and not Bamboo? (the last alphabet 'U' makes our group name stands out and most importantly the alphabet 'U' represents us! )

Topic Choice ( Why did we choose Fuel cells?)

- During the brainstorming session, we came up with other inspiring ideas including virtual reality, Bluetooth and its applications, Battery Technologies

- The reason : we noticed the importance of fuel cell as the cells being a reasonable alternative to battery cars may potentially replace conventional engines in few decades, our decision was heavily influenced by the prof. tasking us to research the topic  "why apple had chosen to make contract with Tesla instead of other companies?' the research ignited our interest in fuel cell.
