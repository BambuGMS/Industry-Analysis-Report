###**Introduction about the Team**

- _Why the name Bambu?_  
	Bambu shares the same pronunciation as the plant **_'bamboo'_** which is strong, fast growing,  has multipurpose utility , and it is also a favorite choice for Chinese fine arts and paintings.

- _Why Bambu and not Bamboo?_  
	The last alphabet **_'U'_** makes our group name stands out and therefore represents us!
