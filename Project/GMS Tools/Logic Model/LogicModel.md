Logic Model V1
------

|**Problem**|
| ------------- |
| As fossil fuels reserves of the planet are not inexhaustible and the energy demand is rising year by year, it is essential to adopt alternative sources of energy. |


|**Goal**|
| ------------- |
| Provide an open Industry Analysis Report (IAR) in order for global knowledge and development opportunities to become available to anyone. |


|**Resources**|**Activities**|**Outcomes**|**Outputs**|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 Supervisor                   | Review Fuel Cell information                | IAR                                 | Know about the fuel cell industry                |
| 20 Contributors                | Extract IAR structure from existing reports | Interaction with other contributors | Know the state and needs of the market           |
| 4 Authors                      | Build a personalized outline for the IAR    |                                     | IAR available to everyone (open online platform) |
| Documentation about IAR        | Collect data                                |                                     | IAR understandable by everyone                   |
| Documentation about fuel cells | Write, design & edit the IAR                |                                     |                                                  |
| Online data sharing platform   | Present IAR project                         |                                     |                                                  |

|**Rationales**|
| ------------- |
| IAR beneficial for stakeholders, customers, researchers, industry, and curious people. |

|**Assumptions**|
| ------------- |
| Enough data is available online.                                                           |
| Hydrogen power has not yet reached its mature stage and will spread to the general public. |
