The history of fuel cell reaches back to the 19th century. Although the commercialization for private customer only started in the recent past. Therefore the market is in an early stage. On the market there are several technologies available. All of them have different specifications and are therefore used in different applications. While MCFC can supply high power demands up to 5 MW other fuel cells like DMFC work in the lower output range up to 1 kW. Thus they are used in different applications which can be divided into stationary, portable  and transport. This shows the great flexibility of fuel cells.
The market size constantly increased in the past years.
Major players on the market are !add firms!
The strong development of fuel cells in some countries is also based on governmental policies, which are playing a big role in the emerging of a new technology. Japan heavily pushed the R&D as well as the market introduction. Therefore it is now the leading country with regard to the fuel cells shipped. Germany is mainly supporting R&D efforts. The USA after using fuel cells already for early NASA missions now also started to support fuel cells especially in California and some other states.
In the future fuel cells have to hold their ground against other emerging technologies like the electric car. A factor which is helpful for this development is that it is forecasted that the price will drop in the long run.
