The history of fuel cell reaches back to the 19th century. Yet the commercialization for private customer only started in the recent past. Therefore the market is in an early stage. On the market there are several technologies available. All of them have different operating characteristics, among which the power output and temperature range are mainly determining the application possibilities. The type of material involved for the electrodes is the critical criteria costwise. One of the objectives in R&D projects therefore is to reduce the quantity of precious metals used so that fuel cells become more affordable. Such an effort is essential for the technology to spread. Indeed, fuel cells already have various applications in our everyday lives thanks to the wide range of power it can provide: while MCFC can supply high power demands up to 5 MW other fuel cells like DMFC work in the lower output range down to 1 mW. Their adoption by the general public is not complete because of the price issues mentioned previously, but also due to the infrastructure they require to work with a maximum effectiveness. This infrastructure shall include distribution facilities and an organized surrounding network that enables the shipping of the gas, but also production plants. Several techniques can be used to generate hydrogen, from gas reforming which emits greenhouse gas, to more innovative ones such as solar direct water splitting, which mimics green natural processes. Electrolysis, on another hand, offers a great opportunity which is to exploit fully renewable - and thus often not controllable - energy sources. The potential for fuel cells therefore is enormous both in applications, but also in fulfilling the promise of a zero emission energy.
The market size remained increasing in the past years. There were several interesting notable trends . As an example, the worldwide fuel cell industry sales surpasses $1 billion for the first time in 2013. And  fuel cell power parks were continually opening in many countries including Japan, Germany, USA but most importantly in Korea where the world's largest fuel cell power plant of 59MW capacity was constructed. The demand for telecommunications backup fuel cells were high in the Middle East, China, the Philippines and other international markets. Major stationary fuel cell manufacturers therefore enjoyed the current situation. The major players on the market are Bloomenergy, Ballard Power Systems, FuelCell Energy, Plugpower and SFC Energy AG. All of these companies collaborate with firms from other industries to bring varieties of fuel cell products into the global market. As a result, many financial and educational institutions started to pay close attention to the evolution of fuel cells.
The strong development of fuel cells in some countries is also based on governmental policies, which are playing a big role in the emerging of a new technology. Japan heavily pushed the R&D as well as the market introduction. Therefore it is now the leading country with regard to the fuel cells shipped. Germany is mainly supporting R&D efforts. What with the USA, after using fuel cells already for early NASA missions, they now also started to support fuel cells for daily use especially in California and some other states.
Fuel cells started to make an appeareance in many off-grid power around the globe, this is because of many countries follow the UK government who utilized stationary fuel cell in powering its offgrid CCTV and saved considerable quantity of time and money that would be invested have it not implemented this technology. This technology is concieved to be very versatile under unstable geographical circumstances. Hydrogen infrastructures on the other hand, is being developed sparsely in many countries but most interestingly in US,California where there  have been ongoing demonstration programs of fuelcell transport vehicle supported by the state goverment. This program already brought more than 50 hydrogen re-fuelling stations into California. 
In the future fuel cells have to hold their ground against other emerging technologies like the electric car. A factor which is helpful for this development is that it is forecasted that the price will drop in the long run, mainly through the mentioned improvement of the technology and economies of scale. The adoption is highly influenced by the price of the competing technologies like electric cars. Still some problems like the high dependency on platinum will remain unsolved in the near future.
