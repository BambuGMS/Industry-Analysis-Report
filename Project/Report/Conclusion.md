The history of fuel cell reaches back to the 19th century. Although the commercialization for private customer only started in the recent past. Therefore the market is in an early stage. On the market there are several technologies available. All of them have different operating characteristics, among which the power output and temperature range are mainly determining which applications they can be found. The type of material used for the electrodes is the critical information costwise. On of the objectives in R&D projects therefore is to reduce the quantity of precious metals used so that fuel cells become more affordable. Such an effort is essential for the technology to spread. Indeed, fuel cells already have various applications in our everyday lives thanks to the wide range of power it can provide: while MCFC can supply high power demands up to 5 MW other fuel cells like DMFC work in the lower output range down to 1 mW. Their adoption by the general public is not complete because of the price issues mentionned previously, but also due to the infrastructure they require to work with a maximum effectiveness. This infrastructure shall include distribution facilities and an organized surrounding network that enable the shipping of the gas, but also production plants. Several techniques can beused to generate hydrogen, from gas reforming which emits greenhouse gas, to more innovative ones such as solar direct water splitting, which mimics green natural processes. Electrolysis, on another hand, offers a great opportunity which is to exploit fully renewable - and thus often not controllable - energy sources. The potential for fuel cells therefore is enormous both in applications, but also in fulfilling the promise of a zero emission energy.
The market size constantly increased in the past years.
Major players on the market are !add firms!
The strong development of fuel cells in some countries is also based on governmental policies, which are playing a big role in the emerging of a new technology. Japan heavily pushed the R&D as well as the market introduction. Therefore it is now the leading country with regard to the fuel cells shipped. Germany is mainly supporting R&D efforts. The USA after using fuel cells already for early NASA missions now also started to support fuel cells especially in California and some other states.
In the future fuel cells have to hold their ground against other emerging technologies like the electric car. A factor which is helpful for this development is that it is forecasted that the price will drop in the long run.
