Meeting Minutes
------

 **TOP FOR TODAY**

1. Distribute the tasks for Wednesday</br>
	* Brochure
	* Presentation
	* Layar

2. Recap on the progress of the writing (that is to be over)


 **PROGRESS DISCUSSTION**

As a new background picture is set (more consistent with the topic), the color set has to be redefined. We chose a set of blues and greys that would correspond better.

1. Distribute the tasks for Wednesday</br>
	* The existing brochure was redesigned to meet a more friendly shape
	* The presentation is to include the requirements: LM, Variables, and progress (using both GIT graphs and progress percentage)
	* The Layar link is only to be made with the final version of the brochure

2. Not all the parts due could be finished for today. However no major hurdle was mentioned. They conequently are being terminated by each of the writers. Only the last future perspective part remains empty. The content is to be discussed after next class. Some progresses however do not appear on GIT, which is a break for the group to progress.
