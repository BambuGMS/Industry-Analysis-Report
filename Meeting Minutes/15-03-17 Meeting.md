***1. Solve the GitHub procedure problems in order to be all able to modify and upload files***

Konstantin gave the standard procedures to follow after having made changes on shared files: add/ commit/ push and other useful tips like commenting on deveral file changes at the same time... Getting used to those new functions.

***2. Determine an outline for the Wednesday presentation***

After making some research for articles and explanations about fuel cell, decided to present our group with the reasons why we picked our name: Bambu, but also the different topics we had considered for the Industry Analysis Report and eventually why Fuel Cells had gotten our interest more specifically. Topics we considered during a brainstorming session, included virtual reality, Bluetooth and its applications, Battery Technologies.
The reason why we decided for fuel cells, was the importance of fuel cell as the cells being a reasonable alternative to battery cars may potentially replace conventional engines in few decades, our decision was heavily influenced by the prof. tasking us to research the topic  "why apple had chosen to make contract with Tesla instead of other companies?' the research ignited our interest in fuel cell.


 **COMMITMENTS**

***Whole Group***
-Read more I.A.R.
-Come up with a structure for the Report (includes gathering data about Fuel Cells)
